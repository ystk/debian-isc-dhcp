This package currently uses dpatch to manage the patches.

Please be aware that there's a bit of a convoluted double-build to build an
LDAP-enabled and non-LDAP-enabled DHCP server package, so the first build is
done with the LDAP patch applied, and then it's unapplied, and a second build
is done.

See /usr/share/doc/dpatch/README.source.gz for more information on how to use
dpatch
